# SJSU Real-Time Threat Detection 🚀  
🔍 **AI-Powered Anomaly Detection for Cybersecurity Logs**  

Welcome to our master project **SJSU-RealTime-Threat-Detection**, which is focused on **real-time log anomaly detection** using **Machine Learning (ML)**, **Kafka**, and **Large Language Models (LLMs)**. Our goal is to develop an intelligent and scalable **cybersecurity threat detection system** that enables proactive defense against evolving cyber threats.
