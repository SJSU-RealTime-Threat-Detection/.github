# SJSU Real-Time Threat Detection
**AI-Powered Anomaly Detection for Cybersecurity Logs**  

Welcome to our master project **SJSU-RealTime-Threat-Detection**, which is focused on **real-time log anomaly detection** using **Machine Learning (ML)**, **Kafka**, and **Large Language Models (LLMs)**. Our goal is to develop an intelligent and scalable **cybersecurity threat detection system** that enables proactive defense against evolving cyber threats.

## üîó Organization Repositories
| Repository | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| [anomaly-web-app](https://github.com/SJSU-RealTime-Threat-Detection/anomaly-web-app) | Simulates and sends attack events to Kafka with a React-based UI for anomaly injection and testing. |
| [log-ingestion-pipeline](https://github.com/SJSU-RealTime-Threat-Detection/log-ingestion-pipeline) | Real-time log generation and ingestion using Kafka for efficient log streaming. |
| [Backend_Services](https://github.com/SJSU-RealTime-Threat-Detection/Backend_Services) | Multiple services that work together to process and analyze logs. Grafana dashboards for visualization and LLM-based contextual insights of anomalies. |
| [anomaly-data-preprocessing](https://github.com/SJSU-RealTime-Threat-Detection/anomaly-data-preprocesssing) | Processes incoming Kafka log streams, cleans data, and extracts features for anomaly detection using ML. |
| [alerting-notification-system](https://github.com/SJSU-RealTime-Threat-Detection/alerting-notification-system) | Handles real-time alerts and notifications via email and SMS. |
